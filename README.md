# Heart Disease Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of heart disease data to identify key factors contributing to heart disease and predict the likelihood of a heart attack. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, and the analysis is conducted using Python and its powerful data analysis libraries in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Project Overview

**age**

**sex**

**chest pain type(4 values)**

   * Value 0: typical angina
   
   * Value 1: atypical angina
   
   * Value 2: non-anginal pain
   
   * Value 3: asymptomatic
   
**trestbps:** resting blood pressure(in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

**>chol:** serum cholstoral in mg/dl

**fbs:** fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl(1=true and 0=false)

**restecg:** resting electrocardiographic results

   * Value 0: normal
   
   * Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation 
              or depression of > 0.05 mV)
   
   * Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' 
              criteria
   
**thalach:** maximum heart rate achieved

**exang:** exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

**oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

**slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

   * Value 1: upsloping
   
   * Value 2: flat
   
   * Value 3: downsloping
   
**ca:** number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

**thal:** 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

**target:**  0=less chance of heart attack, 1=more chance of heart attack


## Project Structure

* Jupyter Notebook: The analysis is performed and documented in a Jupyter Notebook, 
  allowing for an interactive exploration of the data.
  
* Python Scripts: Additional Python scripts are used for data preprocessing and 
  visualization.

## Libraries Used

* NumPy: For numerical computations.
  
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

* Matplotlib: For creating static plots and visualizations.
  
* Seaborn: For advanced data visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-analysis.git
   
2. Navigate into the directory:

       cd heart-disease-analysis
   
3.Install the required Python packages:


       pip install -r requirements.txt
       
4. Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed. You can install it via Anaconda or using pip:

       pip install jupyter
   
## Usage

 * Open the Jupyter Notebook

       jupyter notebook HeartDiseaseAnalysis.ipynb
   
 * Follow the notebook to explore the data analysis, visualizations, and predictive 
   modeling steps
   
## Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the dataset to uncover 
  patterns and insights.
  
* Predictive Modeling: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict heart 
  disease risk.
  
* Data Visualization: Use Python libraries to create informative charts and graphs.
